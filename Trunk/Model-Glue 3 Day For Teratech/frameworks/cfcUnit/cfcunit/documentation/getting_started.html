   	<h3>What is cfcUnit?</h3>
    
	<p>
		cfcUnit is a new member of the xUnit family of unit testing frameworks, written for the CFMX 
		environment using ColdFusion Components and based entirely on the API of the 
		<a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> testing framework. Unit testing is an important part 
		of the software development cycle and the availability of such tools for ColdFusion developers 
		leaves much to be desired.  cfcUnit was built to fulfill the needs of a basic regiment of unit 
		testing while providing the flexibilty to be extended to whatever custom testing solution you 
		can think of.  For more about unit testing, you can read
		<a href="what_is_unit_testing.html">Christian Cantrell's description of unit testing and why you would use it</a>.

  	<h3>Installation</h3>
  	
	<p>
		Due to the number of bug fixes and enhancements with components provided in CFMX 6.1, prior 
		versions will not work. If you do have CFMX but not 6.1 or later, it is a free upgrade from 6.0
		to 6.1.
	</p>
  	
	<p>The cfcUnit distribution is made up of two parts:</p>
  	
	<ol>
  		<li>Core cfcUnit library components (<strong>/org/cfcunit/</strong>)</li>
  		<li>Test runner application files (<strong>/cfcunit/</strong>)</li>
	</ol>
	
  	<p>To deploy cfcUnit, simply unpack the zip file into the webroot. That's it.</p>
  	
	<p>
		If the cfcUnit files have been successfully deployed, you should be able to go right into your 
		browser and open a new test runner. This document assumes that the web site is available at 
		<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost.</a> The test runner application can be found at 
		<a href="http://localhost/cfcunit">http://localhost/cfcunit</a>. Once you have the test runner 
		up, you want to test the core framework files to make sure they are all working properly. To 
		run the tests, enter &quot;cfcunit.tests.AllTests&quot; into the available text field:
	</p>
  	
	<p align="center"><img src="assets/images/testclassdialog.gif" alt="Enter test class" /></p>
  	
	<p>
		There is a text version of the test runner as well as an html version. The Text Runner will tell you if a 
		test passes or fails, but little else. The HTML Runner on the other hand give much more information about 
		each test's success or failure. Select one or the other and click the button labeled &quot;Run Test&quot;. 
		If the tests pass the runner will let you know. If not, then check out the error message and figure out why. 
		Next, run the same tests using the other tests runner to make sure that they both work (for completeness).
	</p>
  	
	<p>
		If you've gotten this far, congratulations! cfcUnit is now installed and ready to be used. Now lets write 
		some tests.
