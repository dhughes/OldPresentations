	<h2>What is Unit Testing?</h2>

	<p>
		Unit testing refers to the practice of developers writing code to test code. It is 
		most important in circumstances where developers write "low-level" code or software 
		components that are intended to be used by other components or otherwise extended.
	</p>
	
	<p>There are two primary ways that unit testing differs from end-user or QA testing:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			The code it tests is generally not accessible from a front end or user interface. 
			It's often lower-level than presentation code.
		</li>
		<li>
			The code it tests is easily quantifiable and measurable. This means it can be tested 
			programmatically; a subjective tester doesn't have to test it.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Writing unit testing code for software components is a good idea because you can catch bugs in 
		low-level code before they reach the user-interface level, where they are often quite difficult 
		to track down.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For example, let's assume you built a ColdFusion component called calc.cfc, which does various 
		mathematical calculations for you. You then use calc.cfc in an application, which retrieves housing 
		prices out of a database, calculates monthly payment scenarios at various interest rates and loan 
		durations, and then displays all the data in an HTML table.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you do not unit test calc.cfc and other low-level code, and someone on the QA team discovers that 
		some of the numbers in the HTML table look incorrect, you might have difficulty tracking down the bug. 
		It could be that the data in the database is wrong, the SQL that retrieves the data from the database 
		is wrong, there is an error in the presentation or number-formatting logic, there is an error in the 
		way you use the calc component's API, or there is simply an error in calc.cfc itself. By writing unit 
		testing code to cover as many situations as possible, you just have to run the code and quickly inspect 
		the easy-to-read results to narrow down the possibilities.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The importance of unit testing code increases the more you are able to reuse and layer your code. 
		For instance, let's say you build a component called bank.cfc that models common bank transactions and 
		makes heavy use of calc.cfc. As before, if you find errors in bank.cfc, you won't know whether the errors 
		reside actually in bank.cfc or calc.cfc unless you can unit test both components.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Unit testing is also invaluable when you decide to refactor software components. Unit tests can tell you 
		instantly whether your refactoring actually broke the component or other components that depend on it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Unit testing is extremely important in environments where multiple developers work on a single project. 
		For instance, if I am writing an application that calculates loan amounts based on real estate information 
		in a database and one morning I update my source tree with all the latest code, it's going to be extremely 
		inconvenient and a huge waste of my time if I update a bunch of little bugs checked in by other developers. 
		If the other developers unit tested their code before checking it in, however, they could catch most of 
		their bugs before they would affect other people's work.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In the past, there was not much need for unit testing in ColdFusion because ColdFusion was primarily a presentation 
		language that lacked a sophisticated ability to put together software components. With the introduction of ColdFusion 
		components, however, a unit testing framework not only became extremely useful, but also was practical to implement 
		and use.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Developers who don't like unit testing code usually argue that it's a waste of time. In other words, for every 
		component you write, you end up having to write a test component along with it, which adds time to the development 
		process. Developers who have been writing unit testing code for a long time, however, counter that the time you 
		save in tracking down and fixing low-level bugs is well worth the relatively small amount of time it takes to 
		write unit tests.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Unit testing frameworks like cfcUnit make the process of writing unit testing code as efficient as possible. 
		Some developers go so far as to write unit testing code before implementing the components that the tests 
		are actually designed to test. Unit testing code is a good way to exercise your API and make sure it's usable 
		and practical.
