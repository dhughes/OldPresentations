Since\r\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\r\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\r\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He\r\nreached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\r\nsome notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\r\nthrew the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the\r\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\r\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\r\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\r\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\r\nhe had moved to, saying, \"Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I\'m Norbert Weiner\r\nand we\'ve just moved.  Would you know where we\'ve moved to?\"  To which the\r\nyoung girl replied, \"Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.\"\r\n	The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\r\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.

Ten percent of our\r\nVAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,\r\neasy to get started with. It\'s great for students, great for somewhat casual\r\nusers, and it\'s great for interchanging programs between different machines.\r\nAnd so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have\r\ngood UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.\r\n	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run\r\nout of things they can do with UNIX. They\'ll want a real system and will end\r\nup doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.\r\n	With UNIX, if you\'re looking for something, you can easily and quickly\r\ncheck that small manual and find out that it\'s not there.  With VMS, no matter\r\nwhat you look for -- it\'s literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if\r\nyou look long enough it\'s there.  That\'s the difference -- the beauty of UNIX\r\nis it\'s simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it\'s all there.\r\n		-- Ken Olsen, president of DEC, DECWORLD Vol. 8 No. 5, 1984\r\n[It\'s been argued that the beauty of UNIX is the same as the beauty of Ken\r\nOlsen\'s brain.

The problem\r\nof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\r\nof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\r\nbian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\r\npond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\r\nthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\r\nto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\r\nfunctions.\r\n	This is not just a let\'s-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\r\nThis is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\r\n	Refreshments will be served.

IMMANUEL \r\nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed \r\nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those \r\nunderlying Plato\'s theory of government, Kant\'s metaphysics, Nietzsche\'s theory\r\nof value, and Husserl\'s phenomenology.

No amount of scientific-sounding\r\njargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central\r\nproblem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which\r\ncelestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .\r\nSome astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents\r\nthe astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those\r\nof any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always\r\nclaim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their\r\nefficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have\r\ngenerously done such testing for them.

Pull one of these\r\n	horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\r\n	of these horses are the same color.

Wisdom was not at the top of the\r\ngraduate school mountain but there in the sandbox at nursery school.\r\n	These are the things I learned:  Share everything.  Play fair.  Don\'t\r\nhit people.  Put things back where you found them.  Clean up your own mess.\r\nDon\'t take things that aren\'t yours.   Say you\'re sorry when you hurt someone.\r\nWash your hands before you eat.  Flush.  Warm cookies and cold milk are good\r\nfor you.  Live a balanced life.  Learn some and think some and draw and paint\r\nand sing and dance and play and work some every day.\r\n	Take a nap every afternoon.  When you go out into the world, watch for\r\ntraffic, hold hands, and stick together.  Be aware of wonder.  Remember the\r\nlittle seed in the plastic cup.   The roots go down and the plant goes up and\r\nnobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.  Goldfish and\r\nhamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup -- they all\r\ndie.  So do we.\r\n	And then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you\r\nlearned, the biggest word of all: LOOK.  Everything you need to know is in\r\nthere somewhere.  The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.  Ecology and\r\npolitics and sane living.\r\n	Think of what a better world it would be if we all -- the whole world\r\n-- had cookies and milk about 3 o\'clock every afternoon and then lay down with\r\nour blankets for a nap.  Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other\r\nnations to always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own\r\nmesses.  And it is still true, no matter how old you are, when you go out into\r\nthe world it is best to hold hands and stick together.\r\n		-- Robert Fulghum, \"All I ever really needed to know I learned\r\n		   in kindergarten\"\r\n'),

The southern roads were\r\nstill five feet between rails.\r\n	It was decided to change the gauge of all southern roads to standard,\r\nin one day.  This remarkable piece of work was carried out on a Sunday in May\r\nof 1886.  For weeks beforehand, shops had been busy pressing wheels in on the\r\naxles to the new and narrower gauge, to have a supply of rolling stock which\r\ncould run on the new track as soon as it was ready.  Finally, on the day set,\r\ngreat numbers of gangs of track layers went to work at dawn.  Everywhere one\r\nrail was loosened, moved in three and one-half inches, and spiked down in its\r\nnew position.  By dark, trains from anywhere in the United States could operate\r\nover the tracks in the South, and a free interchange of freight cars everywhere\r\nwas possible.\r\n		-- Robert Henry, \"Trains\", 1957\r\n'),

She was 17, a girl with big hips, and bending over,\r\nshe looked like the side of a barn.\r\n	I picked up a tomato so big it sat on the ground.  It looked like it\r\nhad sat there a week.  The underside was brown, small white worms lived in it,\r\nand it was very juicy.  I stood up and took aim, and went into the windup,\r\nwhen my mother at the kitchen window called my name in a sharp voice.  I had\r\nto decide quickly.  I decided.\r\n	A rotten Big Boy hitting the target is a memorable sound, like a fat\r\nman doing a belly-flop.  With a whoop and a yell the tomatoee came after\r\nfaster than I knew she could run, and grabbed my shirt and was about to brain\r\nme when Mother called her name in a sharp voice.
