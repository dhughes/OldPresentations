<h2>Eclipse Integration</h2>

<p>
	If you have used the <a href="ant_task.html">cfcUnit Ant task</a> to automate the execution of your unit tests and you
	use Eclipse (or CFEclise) as your ColdFusion code editor, it is possible to have Eclipse run your tests
	each time you save your files. This is done using what are called "Builders", which
	are configurable tasks that are triggered by changes in specific files and folders managed
	by the project. You can create a builder that will execute one or more targets in an Ant build
	file, and therefore it can run your [existing] build target that contains the cfcUnit Ant task.
</p>
<p>
	Below are the directions for setting this up for your own CFEclipse project.
</p>


<h3>Setting up the cfcUnit Builder</h3>
<ol class="directions">
	<li>
		Right-click on the CFML Project and select "Properties" from the menu. The project properties
		window will appear with a menu on the left.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="assets/images/eclipse/project_properties.gif" border="0" align="right" />
		Select "Builders". The list of this project's builders will appear on the right side. If you
		have not configured one of these before, there will be nothing listed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="assets/images/eclipse/choose_configuration_type.gif" align="right" />
		Click the button labeled "New...", select "Ant Build" in the window that pops up, and click 
		"OK". This opens up the properties editor for the new builder.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="assets/images/eclipse/builder_tab_main.gif" align="right" />
		<p>
			First thing to do now is give this new builder a name, and there is a field at the top labeled
			"Name" in which this can be entered. Let's call it "cfcUnit Builder".
		</p>
		<p>
			The first tab, "Main", is where you set general settings for this builder. One of the things we
			must set is the "Buildfile" property, which is the location of the Ant build file. Click
			"Browse Workspace...", select the build.xml for the current project, and click "OK".
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="assets/images/eclipse/builder_tab_targets.gif" align="right" />
		The next tab of interest is "Targets", so select it. The "Auto Build" field contains the name of
		the target in the build file that should be run each time one of the project's files is
		modified.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="assets/images/eclipse/builder_tab_targets_set_target.gif" align="right" />
		Click "Set Targets..." for this field, select the build target that contains the
		cfcUnit task you want this builder to run, and click "OK".
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="assets/images/eclipse/builder_tab_buildoptions.gif" align="right" />
		The last tab you need to worry about is "Build Options". Select it, and check the option labeled
		"Allocate Console". This makes sure that if this builder runs an output console is created if
		one is not open.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="assets/images/eclipse/builder_tab_buildoptions_workingset.gif" align="right" />
		<p>
			The last thing you need to do is tell the builder which files it needs to monitor for
			changes. To do this, check the box labeled "Specify working set of relevant resources" and
			click the button to the right labeled "Specify Resources...".
		</p>
		<p>
			The dialog that appears shows all files for all the projects in the current workspace. First,
			Find the files or directories that you want to trigger this builder. Then make sure you give
			this working set a name in the field labeled "Working set name". Click the button labeled
			"Finish".
		</p>
	</li>	
	<li>
		All the appropriate properties have been set, so you can click "OK" at the bottom right corner of 
		the window. You should be looking at the list of builders that now includes the one you just created. 
		Make sure it is checked (if you want it to run), and click "OK" at the bottom.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Congratulations! You have just set up you Eclipse project so that you are testing your code every time
	you change it.
